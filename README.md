# Resume/Job Search Resources

On this page are a few resources I've used to a decent degree of success in the tech job search. This includes resume pointers, interview resources, and general learning resources.


# Resume
### Section Ordering
1. Basic Contact Info
2. Optional: High level summary and skillset, though this should not take more than 1/6 the page
3. Work Experience (should take up as much of the page as possible)
4. Education
5. Additional Projects

### Basic Contact Info
You should include:
- your preferred name
- general area where you live (full address not necessary)
- email address
- phone number (optional)
- LinkedIn profile

For engineers, also include:
- GitHub profile
- personal portfolio

### High Level Summary
This is basically your chance to fish for AI keywords. Every coding language, Agile web tool, testing framework, database, web host, etc should all be in here. This is also your chance to list some bullet points that might match some of those listed on the job descriptions of the positions you are applying for.


### Work Experience
List your work experience in reverse chronological order. Be aware that recruiter's eyes will skim along the left side, on the first word of each bullet point, so definitely make sure the first word of each line is catchy to the recruiter. These are called power verbs, and a list of them can be found [here](https://capd.mit.edu/resources/resume-action-verbs/).

You'll want to include all projects you were a part of where you made use of a prominent technology, took leadership/ownership, collaborated cross functionally, or made a positive impact on the company either financially or efficiency-wise.

### Education
Keep this short and sweet. One line per degree should be enough, and even multiple degrees can be consolidated to fewer lines. If you went to a bootcamp, it's often recommended to keep the bootcamp off your resume.

### Additional Projects
Personal projects and open source contributions should go here. If you made a project or contribution that is niche, word it in  a way that a recruiter with no background information can understand it.

I find [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/) to be the best resource over Glassdoor and Blind to get a view of what salaries to expect. It gives you a reasonable salary range to target during negotiations that is from a reliable source.
